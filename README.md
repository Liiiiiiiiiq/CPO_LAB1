# Example project

This is an example project which demonstrates project structure and necessary
CI checks. It is not the best structure for real-world projects, but good
enough for educational purposes.

## Project structure

- `foo.py` -- implementation of `Foo` class with `hello` and `add` features.
   Stateless.
- `foo_test.py` -- unit and PBT tests for `Foo`.

## Features

- PBT: `test_add_commutative`
